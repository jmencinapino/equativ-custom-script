# Equativ Custom Script

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the possibilities available when using the Equativ Custom Script feature at the insertion and creative levels.

## General Use

The Equativ Custom Script is primarily used to integrate additional or specialized features that are not included by default in Equativ's services or products. These features allow for flexibility and customization to meet specific needs. 

Some common use cases include:
- **Integrating custom styles (CSS):** To apply unique branding or aesthetic details.
- **Adding tracking pixels:** For cases where pixel integration is restricted by the template.
- **Embedding additional scripts or code snippets:** To enhance or complement specific functionalities.

### Note
> Proper validation of your custom code is essential to ensure compatibility with the Equativ platform and to avoid performance issues.

## Third-Party Integrations

A popular application of the Equativ Custom Script is to facilitate third-party integrations, especially for analytics or measurement tools.

### IAS Viewability Integration

One notable example is the integration of **Integral Ad Science (IAS)** for additional viewability measurements. This setup often requires a custom implementation using the Equativ Custom Script.

For detailed instructions and example code, please refer to the dedicated repository: [IAS Viewability Integration](https://github.com/jmencinapino/ias-viewability-integration)

### Important
> Always test third-party integrations in a controlled environment before deploying to production. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when handling user data.

### Warning
> Custom scripts can introduce security risks or performance degradation if not implemented properly. Exercise caution and consult the Equativ support team if unsure.
